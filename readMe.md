# Trello Clone  

## Description  
This is a **Trello-style task manager** I built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  

The app lets you create tasks, move them between boards (To Do, In Progress, Done), and save them in **LocalStorage** so they don’t disappear after refresh.  

I added **Dark/Light mode**, **Due dates with urgency colors**, and **Export JSON** to practice more advanced skills.

## Features  
- Add new tasks.  
- Drag & drop tasks between columns.  
- Save tasks in LocalStorage.  
- Dark/Light mode toggle.  
- Due date with green/yellow/red urgency colors.  
- Export tasks as JSON file.

## Why I Built This  
I built this app to learn:  
- How to use **DOM manipulation** to add and move cards.  
- How to use **Drag & Drop API**.  
- How to use **localStorage** to keep data even after refresh.  
- How to handle **dates and conditions** in JavaScript.  
- **NB: to create webapp using mobile first approach for responsiveness**

## What I Achieved  
- Functional **Kanban board** (like Trello).  
- Learned how to connect DOM + localStorage.  
- Practiced condition logic for deadlines.  
- Created a real-world tool that can help with tasks.
